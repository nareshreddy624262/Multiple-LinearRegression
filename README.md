# Multiple-LinearRegression



# Car Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting car prices using a multiple linear regression model. Multiple linear regression is a statistical technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. In this case, we use various car features to predict its price.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of several features that affect the price of a car. These features include variables like the car's make, model, year, mileage, engine size, and more.

### Features
- **Car Make**: The manufacturer of the car (e.g., Toyota, Honda, etc.)
- **Car Model**: The model of the car.
- **Year**: The manufacturing year of the car.
- **Mileage**: The total kilometers/miles the car has been driven.
- **Engine Size**: The size of the car's engine.
- **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., petrol, diesel, electric).
- **Transmission**: The type of transmission (manual, automatic).
- **Price**: The target variable representing the car's price.

## Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

You can install the required packages by running:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Project Structure
```
|-- dataset.csv              # CSV file containing car data and prices
|-- multiple_linear_regression.py  # Main Python script for the multiple linear regression model
|-- README.md                # Project documentation (this file)
```

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and prepared by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling the data.
3. **Feature Selection**: The relevant features are selected to train the model.
4. **Model Training**: A multiple linear regression model is trained using the training data.
5. **Prediction**: The model predicts car prices for the test data.
6. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

## Running the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python multiple_linear_regression.py
   ```

## Example Output
The model will output the predicted car prices based on the given features along with the performance metrics such as MAE and R-squared values.

## Visualization
If you wish to visualize the relationships between features and car prices, the script includes code to plot graphs that can help understand feature importance and correlations.
